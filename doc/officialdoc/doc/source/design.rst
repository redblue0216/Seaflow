Design
======
	- Extensive use of metaprogramming technology to improve code flexibility, readability, and maintenance quality

	- Modular design, including the five major concepts of Node, Scheduler, DataCatalog, Hook, and Runner
		
		- Node: Callable nodes for fine-grained control
		
		- Scheduler: Optimization of Various Algorithms Based on Graph Theory
		
		- DataCatalog: Cache optimization to reduce operational pressure
		
		- Hook: Dynamic plugin method, flexible and scalable
		
		- Runner： Based on the Ray computing engine, it naturally supports heterogeneous, distributed, and flexible scalability 
	
	- Automatic optimization design, storage optimization, and calculation optimization based on backend graph theory algorithms and storage components for automatic optimization
